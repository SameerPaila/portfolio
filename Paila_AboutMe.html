                <p class="col-sm-8">My name is Sameer Paila, I am 15 years old and I am currently a sophomore at Dublin High School. 
                Some things that interest me include golf, aeronautical and aerospace engineering, astronomy, aviation, 
                and speech and debate. I have been playing golf at a competitive level for the last 6 years and I also 
                ranked number 2 on the school varsity team during my freshman year. I began doing public forum debate in freshman
                year and my interest for it has carried on to my sophomore year. During the first semester of sophomore year alone, I
                participated in 3 separate debate tournaments and either won the undefeated or winning record awards in all of them. Throughout my life, 
                I have been fascinated by the world of aviation and to fuel my interest, I bought my own flight simulation system to conduct 
                realistic flights as a virtual pilot. In addition to being a pilot, I have always been intrigued by the idea of building 
                faster and more efficient methods of aerial transportation within the Earth's atmosphere and in outerspace. Recently, I have been 
                more interested in coding, computer programming, and software engineering and I wish to take my skills further to implement them in
                the future for a career pathway of my choosing. The purpose of this dynamic website is to keep track of my progress 
                throughout high school and build a resume for college applications and job applications. Over the next three years of
                during which I will be in high school, this website will be updated with the latest information about me. Any projects
                done in class for engineering will be logged under the "projects" page and a summary of the project will also be included.
                The "resume" page will be used to construct my portfolio so that I can display it in the future for potential opportunities.
