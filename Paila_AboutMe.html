                <p class="col-sm-8">My name is Sameer Paila, I am 16 years old and I am currently a junior at Dublin High School. 
                Some things that interest me include golf, aeronautical and aerospace engineering, astronomy, aviation, 
                politics, and law. I have been playing golf at a competitive level for the last 6 years and I also 
                ranked number 2 on the school varsity team during my freshman and sophomore years. As a person who enjoys discussing controversial topics and the law,
                I began doing public forum debate in freshman year and my interest for it has carried on to my sophomore and junior years. During the first semester of my sophomore year alone, I
                participated in 3 separate debate tournaments and either won the undefeated or winning record awards in all of them. Throughout my life, 
                I have been fascinated by the world of aviation and to fuel my interest, I bought my own flight simulation system to conduct 
                realistic flights as a virtual pilot. In addition to being a pilot, I have always been intrigued by the idea of building 
                faster and more efficient methods of aerial transportation within the Earth's atmosphere and in outerspace. In the past year, I have also been
                more interested in computer science and I wish to take my skills further to implement them in
                the future for a career pathway of my choosing. To fulfill my interest in computer science, I decided to take
                an introductory computer science class in sophomore year. Participating in this class allowed me to gain important skills and knowledge about
                different coding languages and the world of computers in general. Then, in junior year, I decided to take the class known as 
                Principles of Engineering (POE) in order to gain useful insight about other fields of engineering that I showed interest in, such as mechanical engineering,
                aeronautical engineering, and structural/ civil engineering. The purpose of this dynamic website is to keep track of my progress 
                throughout high school and build a resume for future college and job applications. Over the next two years                
                during which I will be in high school, this website will be updated with the latest information about me. Any projects
                done in class for engineering will be logged under the "projects" page and a summary of the project will also be included.
                The "resume" page will be used to construct the main facets of my portfolio so that I can display it in the future for any potential interviews concerning career opportunities.
