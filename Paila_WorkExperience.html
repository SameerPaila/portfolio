                    <p>As an aviation enthusiast myself who has a personal in-home flight simulator, going on this field trip to the Patriots Jet Team Hangar in Byron
                    was extremely insightful and interesting to me. Upon arriving at the hangar, we were immediately greeted by a Vietnam War air force veteran who had gone on to continue fueling
                    his love for aviation by becoming a jet team pilot himself. At the hangar, historical fighter jets such as the Russian MIG-17F could be seen on display. To me, one of the most
                    interesting parts of the trip were the different statistics that each plane had. Often times, it is easy to dismiss fighter jets as all having the same function - to go fast and 
                    be maneuverable. However, seeing the unique capabilities of each plane allowed me to better assess its aerodynamical design and its primary purpose in combat. For example, the MIG
                    had a formidable climb rate of 12,000 feet per minute; this made it very easy for MIG pilots to outclimb and outpace enemy fighter jets while they were engaged in combat. Perhaps
                    the most interesting thing I learned on this trip was about the evolution of the jet engine. Three main types of engines were covered: turbojet engines, turbofan engines, and turboprop
                    engines. Learning about the specifics of each engine allowed me to understand the functionality of each type of engine on different types of airplanes. For example, turbofan engines are used
                    on such airplanes as the Boeing 747 and Boeing 777 for purposes of noise efficiency and fuel efficiency on long haul flights. On the other hand, turboprop engines are used more on smaller regional 
                    airplanes, such as the Bombardier Dash-8 Q400, because they are smaller and generally more efficient for short haul flights. Overall, this experience was an extremely useful one because not only
                    did it provide me with further insights into aviation to fuel my interest in the field, but it also played a large role in helping me complete my aerodynamic design project.</p>

                <div class = "container col-sm-5">
                    <h5>Class: POE (Principles of Engineering)</h5>
                    <h5>When: February 14, 2019</h5>
                    <h5>Duration: 2:36 - 3:27 (51 minutes)</h5>
                    <h5>Topic: Materials Testing</h5>
                </div>
                <div class = "container col-sm-7">
                    <p>Both guest speakers, Cristiano Melo and Tim Rodriguez, were employees at the private engineering firm, BSK associates. BSK associates is
                    a consulting engineering firm that mainly does materials testing for construction contractors. Prior to hearing Mr. Melo and Mr. Rodriguez speak, I thought
                    that the construction process for a given building was fairly simple - cast a strong foundation with concrete and then build any desired structure on top. However, their
                    detailed presentation proved my oversimplified definition of construction wrong. Throughout their presentation, both speakers specifically focused on the equipment and construction machines
                    used to conduct materials tests and field tests. For example, during field tests, construction teams would take soil and rock samples and analyze them for their material composition in order
                    to determine whether a deep or shallow foundation should be built. After that, different types of construction vehicles are used at each step of the construction process in order to finish tasks
                    as precisely and efficiently as possible. In lab tests, stress tests, namely compression and tensile tests, are conducted on various materials to determine their structural integrity and most suitable
                    application in a building. Although I do not intend to pursue a degree in any form of civil or structural engineering as of right now, Mr. Melo and Mr. Rodriguez definitely played a vital role in helping
                    me understand the facets of modern-day construction.</p>
