                    <h5>Course: CSE (Computer Science and Engineering: Entry Level Course)</h5>
                    <h5>Duration: About 3 weeks (August-September)</h5>
                    <h5>Objective: Make an interactive game or story using the Scratch programming language</h5>
                    <h5>Type of Project: Partner project (2 people)</h5>
                    <p>For the scratch project, my partner and I began by going over the 
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KGkh-4VVxykHx_gpCXqSFi2AI0Yn-Jj2UoWmQv9ezlo/edit" target="blank">basic tutorial</a>
                    for the programming language. This tutorial introduced us to the multiple variable roles in Scratch and it also familiarized
                    us with the block oriented code that Scratch uses. After the tutorial was completed, we were told by our instructor that our
                    project would involve creating an original story or game for people to play. We began by delegating tasks to each member and creating a 
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dBp0ZZCrXzMCIa-ookhUK-UmbcNf2ePbbx2zWu4bDQI/edit" target="blank">project notebook</a>
                    which would be used on a daily basis to keep track of our progress. We brainstormed different ideas and 
                    concluded that it would be best to program an RPG (role-playing game) with multiple levels and enemies with different characteristics 
                    because that was what appealed to us the most. Then, we presented our ideas in a professional manner to another group in the class to get valuable 
                    feedback and improve our final product. The last part of the pre-programming process was completed after a flowchart was designed to clearly display 
                    our ideas and prioritize them under different tiers to provide us with an outline of what we wanted to do. The daily log, 
                    flowchart, brainstorming session, feedback session, and more can be viewed on the project notebook for further information regarding the design process. 
                    My partner and I scored well on this project because the game was fully functional, easy-to-play and practical, and most parts of the <a 
                    href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit" target="blank">rubric</a> were followed. Take a look at
                    the game we created! It can be played to the right. To play, use the arrow keys to move the character, press the s and d keys to toggle player stats display,
                    click on enemies to inflict damage, and move the character to the right edge of the screen to advance to the next level.

                    <p> For the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wp9_swt29piCMyCC8rl4iVvOa2mhee1q0ZmHlknJ0ok/edit" target="blank">MIT app inventor project</a>, 
                    my partner and I were assigned with the task of improving and extending upon a game given to us from a range of basic 
                    tutorials. My partner and I began the project by brainstorming some ideas and finding which tutorial best suited our ideas. Since we wanted to create 
                    a game with multiple levels, enemies, and objectives, we believed that the <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/get-gold.html" target="blank">
                    Get The Gold for AI2 tutorial</a> would be the best layout to start with. Similar to the scratch project, we created a 
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jd5yoF2OHcUSunm358NI_zLAD0GN2_-Qk2JCQj1MeH8/edit" target="blank">project notebook</a> and 
                    after brainstorming ideas for what our game should include, we presented them to another group who listened to our pitch and gave us some helpful suggestions. 
                    The flowchart for this project was used to organize our thoughts and feedback to develop a final app which incorporated all of the desired aspects. 
                    A daily log was also used to keep track of individual and group progress which was useful in determining what aspects of the game we 
                    wanted to prioritize and what aspects could be saved for future development. My partner and I scored decently well on this project because we met the majority
                    of the requirements mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wfz6ZMU6gUYuBKOPbIQ9qQtfNuOjzAsGTHJdqGx0tBI/edit" target="blank">rubric</a> and
                    the app appeared to work the majority of the time when it was downloaded and played on a mobile device. A picture of the home screen of our app/game can be seen to the right.

                    <p> For the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nMqH-R9JE_lgE0ZbBZy3OLaFw9e1TcXvQjJKqSixy1E/edit" target="blank">Python Text Adventure Project</a> 
                    ,my partner and I were assigned with the task of using the python programming language to develop a text-based interactive
                    game or story. Since this assignment was only considered a 'mini-project', no notebook was maintained. Instead, all of our ideas were directly
                    collected on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hdmi_EKV_XBQDYJp8Dq7Bzsjxlq21QRbq1f7lnFEOhg/edit" target="blank"> flowchart</a>.
                    To begin the project, we brainstormed by selecting different themes or topics that could be implemented in humorous and
                    creative way. After brainstorming, we decided to base our project around a story involving scammers. We chose this theme because not only 
                    was it original and creative, but it also allowed us to add many options and pathways for the player to choose from. After developing our flowchart and coming
                    to a consensus on the different portions of the story, we immediately began programming. To avoid too many nested if-else structures, most of our code was
                    dominated by individual if-else structures and functions which were called upon. Since we gave ourselves more time to program, 
                    we were able to successfully complete all aspects of our story that were mentioned on the flowchart. My partner and I received a perfect score on this project because
                    all the requirements listed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nMqH-R9JE_lgE0ZbBZy3OLaFw9e1TcXvQjJKqSixy1E/edit" target="blank"> rubric </a> were met.
